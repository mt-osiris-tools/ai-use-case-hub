### Token Usage Analysis

| Operation | Estimated Tokens | Cost (USD) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|------------|-------|
| Component structure and TypeScript interfaces | ~1500 tokens | ~$0.03 | Generated base component with full type safety |
| Button variants and styling | ~2000 tokens | ~$0.04 | Created 5 button variants with responsive design |
| Accessibility implementation | ~800 tokens | ~$0.016 | Added WCAG-compliant accessibility features |
| Test suite generation | ~900 tokens | ~$0.018 | Comprehensive test coverage including a11y tests |
| **Total Estimated** | **~5200 tokens** | **~$0.10** | **Full end-to-end workflow** |

### Cost Efficiency Analysis

- **Manual Alternative:** 2 hours × $85/hour = $170

### Code Generated

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger' | 'success' | 'ghost';
  size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  disabled?: boolean;
  loading?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  'aria-label'?: string;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'medium',
  disabled = false,
  loading = false,
  children,
  onClick,
  ...props
}) => {
  return (
    <StyledButton
      variant={variant}
      size={size}
      disabled={disabled || loading}
      onClick={onClick}
      {...props}
    >
      {loading ? <Spinner /> : children}
    </StyledButton>
  );
};
```

### Key Technical Insights

1. **Technical Insight:** TypeScript interfaces significantly improve component API clarity and developer experience
2. **Technical Insight:** AI-generated accessibility features often exceed manual implementation quality
3. **Technical Insight:** Automated test generation covers edge cases developers commonly miss
