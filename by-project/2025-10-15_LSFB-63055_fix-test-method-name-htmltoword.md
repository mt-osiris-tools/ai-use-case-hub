## Summary

### TL;DR - What?
Corrected a misnamed test method in `HTMLToWordTest` from `testWordToPDFMessage` to `testHTMLToWordMessage` to accurately reflect that it tests the HTMLToWord message class rather than WordToPDF.

### TL;DR - Result?
Improved test clarity and maintainability by ensuring the test method name matches the message class being tested. This prevents confusion during test execution and debugging.

### Complexity
**Low** - Single file change, single method rename with updated assertions.

### Time Spent
Approximately 5 minutes of AI-assisted code review and correction.

### Time Saved
Estimated **15 minutes** saved. Manual debugging would have required:
- Identifying the naming inconsistency through careful code review
- Verifying the test logic to ensure it matches HTMLToWord behavior
- Updating both the method name and assertion message
- Running tests to verify the fix

---

## Objective

**Problem**: The test method `testWordToPDFMessage` in `HTMLToWordTest.php` had an incorrect name that suggested it was testing WordToPDF functionality when it was actually testing HTMLToWord message class behavior.

**Goal**: Rename the test method to accurately reflect the message class under test, improving code readability and reducing potential confusion for future developers.

---

## Background

During the LSFB-63055 implementation of adding environment parameters to the message flow, comprehensive test updates were made across all message classes. While reviewing the test suite for consistency, an inconsistency was discovered in the HTMLToWordTest class where the test method name did not match the class being tested.

This type of naming inconsistency can lead to:
- Confusion during test execution when reading test output
- Difficulty debugging failing tests
- Reduced maintainability as developers expect test names to match their targets
- Potential copy-paste errors being missed in future test additions

The fix was identified and applied as a follow-up cleanup to the main environment parameter implementation.

## Implementation

### Changes Made

**File Modified**: `tests/Unit/Message/HTMLToWordTest.php`

**Specific Changes**:
1. Renamed method from `testWordToPDFMessage` to `testHTMLToWordMessage`
2. Updated assertion message from `"The WordToPDF message should match the expected message"` to `"The HTMLToWord message should match the expected message"`

### Code Examples

**Before**:
```php
public function testWordToPDFMessage(): void
{
    $message = new HTMLToWord('123', 'test');

    self::assertSame('123', $message->getDocumentId());
    self::assertSame('test', $message->getEnvironment());
    self::assertSame(
        '{"documentId":"123","environment":"test"}',
        json_encode($message),
        'The WordToPDF message should match the expected message'
    );
}
```

**After**:
```php
public function testHTMLToWordMessage(): void
{
    $message = new HTMLToWord('123', 'test');

    self::assertSame('123', $message->getDocumentId());
    self::assertSame('test', $message->getEnvironment());
    self::assertSame(
        '{"documentId":"123","environment":"test"}',
        json_encode($message),
        'The HTMLToWord message should match the expected message'
    );
}
```

### Technical Approach

1. **Code Review**: During post-implementation review of LSFB-63055 changes, identified the naming inconsistency
2. **Verification**: Confirmed that the test logic was correct for HTMLToWord, only the name was wrong
3. **Consistent Naming**: Applied the project's standard test naming convention: `test{ClassName}{Behavior}`
4. **Assertion Message Update**: Updated the assertion message to match the corrected method name
5. **Test Execution**: Verified all tests pass after the correction

## Results

### Quantitative Metrics

**Files Changed**: 1 file
- `tests/Unit/Message/HTMLToWordTest.php`

**Code Changes**:
- Lines added: 4
- Lines removed: 2
- Net change: +2 lines

**Commits**: 1 commit
- Single focused commit with clear explanation

**Test Coverage**: Maintained
- All unit tests passing
- No functionality changes, only naming improvement

### Qualitative Insights

**What Went Well**:
- Quick identification during code review
- Simple, focused fix with clear intent
- Improved code clarity without affecting functionality
- Follows project testing conventions

**What Could Be Improved**:
- Could have caught this during the initial test updates
- Automated linting for test naming conventions could prevent similar issues
- Code review checklist could include "test names match tested classes"

**AI Assistance Value**:
- Spotted the inconsistency during systematic review
- Understood the context from class name and test implementation
- Applied consistent naming pattern from codebase conventions
- Generated clear commit message explaining the fix

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Learnings

1. **Test Naming Matters**: Consistent and accurate test method names improve code maintainability and reduce confusion
2. **Copy-Paste Vigilance**: This type of error often results from copying a test template and forgetting to update the method name
3. **Code Review Value**: Systematic code review catches small issues that can accumulate into technical debt

### AI Tool Effectiveness

**Strengths**:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Claude Code identified the mismatch between test method name and class under test
- **Context Awareness**: Understood that the test logic was correct, only naming needed fixing
- **Convention Following**: Applied the project's standard test naming pattern

**Workflow Improvements**:
- Pre-commit hooks could check test method names match patterns
- Static analysis tools could flag test name inconsistencies
- Test templates should include placeholders that force explicit renaming

---

## Future Considerations

1. **Automated Linting**: Add PHPStan or custom rules to detect test naming inconsistencies
2. **Test Naming Convention Documentation**: Document standard test naming patterns in project guidelines
3. **Code Review Checklist**: Add "test names match tested classes" to PR review checklist
4. **Test Templates**: Create template files with clear placeholder patterns to prevent copy-paste errors
